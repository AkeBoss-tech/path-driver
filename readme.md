# Robot Path Following Visualizer
Drive around the robot using the arrow keys. Select points on the canvas to generate segments for the robot to follow. 

Press enter for the car to follow the path.

Try fine tuning some of the parameters using the sliders. 

Currently, I just made my own path following algorithm. I will be implementing other controllers like pure pursuit in the future.
